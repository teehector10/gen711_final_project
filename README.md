## BACKGROUND
Our final project focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic which has taken places over the past couple years. COVID-19 is a disease caused by the highly transmissbale SARS-CoV-2, and this project specifcially looks at the human transmission isolation source of the oronasopharynx, meaning the mouth, nose, and pharynx region of the body. This study was inspired by a research report published in March 2021, which discusses in depth the sequencing methods that could be employed to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and relate this information to treatment methodologies in the future for affected patients. The paper compares ACE2 receptor expression levels in human tissue at a variety of locations across the body which correlates to the origin SARS-CoV-2 infection site in each patient (Xiaomin et al. 2021). Next-generation sequencing techniques of the metagenome and single-cell sequencing was applied to locate SARS-CoV-2 tissue hosts, to prevent interspecies transmission for this disease as well as other public health scares to come. This project compares fasta files of two different COVID-19 nucleotide geneome sequences of oronasopharynx isolation, April 2020 vs April 2022, of United States patients via a Phylogenetic tree for visualization and running a BLAST for nucleotide sequence similarities by basepair. 

#### Figure 1 
This image from the previously cited paper titled "Next-Generation Sequencing Revals the Progression of COVID-19" shows ACE2 expression levels in the human body as percentages per organ location (Xiaomin, et al. 2021). To apply to our project, the thyroid level of expression can correlate to the oronasopharynx region.

## Methods 
We took two SARS-CoV2 Genome sequences from April 2020 and April 2022 i
